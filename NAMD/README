We use the NAMD 2.15 as mentioned in NAMD_Source/notes.txt from the NAMD web site http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/.

The build instructions are in buildit.sh

We only made one change to source code:
We use two versions of the code - one which uses the ivdep pragma on a key loop and one which does not. Please see our comment on line 65 in NAMD_Source/src/ComputeNonbondedBase2.h

The run instructions are within antero-script and castle-script within stmv/ directory that also contains the dataset. The two scripts are for antero and castle nodes with AMD genoa and Intel sapphire-rapids processors, respectively.

To build for genoa, rome, sapphire-rapids and broadwell targets, we respectively use the following modules:
craype-x86-genoa, craype-x86-rome, craype-x86-spr, craype-broadwell
