This repository contains the following:
(1) HPCaaS-Bench - All 6 applications within HPCaaS-Bench. It contains the source code (only binaries in a couple of cases to keep the repository small), build instructions/scripts and run instructions/scripts for the various applications. For each application, we provide the material needed to participate in the hands-on sessions.
(2) DEMO - it contains a small demo that shows how to create an account on HPE devCloud, the system that we plan to use for the hands-on sessions with all the applications and also provides some insight into the variety of software and hardware options that are available to users to choose from in the Cloud.
(3) SAMPLE SLIDES - contains sample slides that we also provided in the SC23 tutorial submission page
(4) Detailed-Experimental-Results.pdf - This is detailed paper that describes the experiments performed with each application and also explains the reasons behind observed performance (not part of sample slides). Furthermore, it also provides more details around applications, datasets and finally summarizes the overall lessons learnt.
