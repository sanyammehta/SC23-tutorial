We only provide the OpenFOAM binary and the dataset here not the huge source code to keep the repository small.
Also, we currently only provide the dataset for 128 rank case only whereas we ran it for 128, 256, 512, 1024 and 2048 ranks. This is again to keep the repository small.

The binary was built with the Cray compiler and linked with cray-mpich. It is located at OpenFOAM_HPE_Rhel8.6_Craype2.7.17_V2012_BASERELEASE_O3DEFAULT/OpenFOAM-v2012/platforms/linux64CrayDPInt32Opt/bin/simpleFoam

The run-script is Ofoam.x.96b. The commands of interest is located at lines 2604-2608 that contain the different distribution strategies that we test with OpenFOAM.

We launch the run-script with the following options:
sbatch -q hotlum --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=128 --exclusive --overcommit  --export=ALL,NPROC=128,DECOMP=0,MPITYPE=CRAY,AMD7702=1,ALT1=1,MACH=hotlum,CRAY_MPICH_USE_SRUN=1 ./Ofoam.x.96b
