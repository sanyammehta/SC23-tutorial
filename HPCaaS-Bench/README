HPCaaS-Bench is a suite of six applications from six key verticals in HPCaaS.
The verticals and applications are:

(1) Financial Services Industry - Monte Carlo Options Pricing
(2) Life Sciences (Pharmaceuticals) - NAMD
(3) Finite Element Analysis - OpenRadioss
(4) Weather Forecasting - MPAS-A
(5) Computational Fluid Dynamics - OpenFOAM
(6) Oil and Gas Industry - Specfem3D (coming soon!)

There's a directory for each of these applications that contains source code with build instructions/scripts and/or binaries with run instructions/scripts 
depending on application and the experiment for the purpose of SC tutorial. We do not include source code (or all the datasets) in some cases to contain 
the size of the repository here, but we will, of course, provide everything needed for the actual tutorial to make for a smooth and great experience!
